## Running the Script in Steps

### Windows
1. **Download PHP**:
   - Download PHP version 8.3 VS16 X64 Thread Safe via the following link:  
     [https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.3](https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.3)
   - After downloading PHP, move it to the correct path, preferably `C:/php`.
   - Run it, then go to **Properties** > **This PC** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**. Edit and add a new path: `C:\php`.

2. **Download Apache**:
   - Download Apache 2.4.6 Win64 via the link:  
     [https://www.apachelounge.com/download/](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/)
   - After downloading Apache, move it to the correct path, preferably `C:/apache24`.

3. **Prepare the Wise Project**:
   - Move the Wise project to the `htdocs` folder inside your Apache directory.
   - Open the Apache configuration file: `C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf`.
   - Modify the `DocumentRoot` and `<Directory>` sections to point to `htdocs/wise/public`. For example:
     ```
     DocumentRoot "C:/Apache24/htdocs/wise/public"
     <Directory "C:/Apache24/htdocs/wise/public">
         AllowOverride All
         Require all granted
     </Directory>
     ```
   - Change `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All` in the `<Directory>` section.

4. **Link PHP with Apache**:
   - Ensure Apache is not running and open its configuration file: `C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf`.
   - Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:
     ```
     # PHP8 module
     PHPIniDir "C:/php"
     LoadModule php_module "C:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"
     AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
     ```
   - Enable rewrite mode in `httpd.conf` by uncommenting the following line (remove the `#` at the beginning):
     ```
     #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
     ```
   - Save the file after making this change.

5. **Run Apache**:
   - Open CMD and navigate to the Apache folder.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     httpd.exe -k install
     httpd.exe -k start
     ```

## Running the Script in Steps

### Windows
1. **Download PHP**:
   - Download PHP version 8.3 VS16 X64 Thread Safe via the following link:  
     [https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.3](https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.3)
   - After downloading PHP, move it to the correct path, preferably `C:/php`.

2. **Download Apache**:
   - Download Apache 2.4.6 Win64 via the link:  
     [https://www.apachelounge.com/download/](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/)
   - After downloading Apache, move it to the correct path, preferably `C:/apache24`.

3. **Prepare the Wise Project**:
   - Move the Wise project to the `htdocs` folder inside your Apache directory.
   - Open the Apache configuration file: `C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf`.
   - Modify the `DocumentRoot` and `<Directory>` sections to point to `htdocs/wise/public`. For example:
     ```
     DocumentRoot "C:/Apache24/htdocs/wise/public"
     <Directory "C:/Apache24/htdocs/wise/public">
         AllowOverride All
         Require all granted
     </Directory>
     ```
   - Change `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All` in the `<Directory>` section.
   - Change `DirectoryIndex index.html` to `DirectoryIndex index.php`.
   - Update the `ServerName` directive Change from: ``#ServerName www.example.com:80`` To:
     ```
     ServerName localhost:80
     ```
     Ensure you remove the `#` from the `ServerName` line.

4. **Link PHP with Apache**:
   - Ensure Apache is not running and open its configuration file: `C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf`.
   - Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:
     ```
     # PHP8 module
     PHPIniDir "C:/php"
     LoadModule php_module "C:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"
     AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
     ```
   - Enable rewrite mode in `httpd.conf` by uncommenting the following line (remove the `#` at the beginning):
     ```
     #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
     ```
   - Save the file after making this change.

5. **Run Apache**:
   - Open CMD and navigate to the Apache folder.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     C:/Apache24/bin/httpd.exe -k install
     C:/Apache24/bin/httpd.exe -k start
     ```
6. **Enable the PDO MySQL & MySQLi Extension**:
    - Open your php.ini file. This file is usually located in the PHP installation directory, for example:
      ```C:\php\php.ini```
        - Search for the following line:
           ```
          ;extension=pdo_mysql
          ;extension=mysqli
            ```
            - Remove the semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line to uncomment it:
          ```
          extension=pdo_mysql
          extension=mysqli
          ```
            - Restart Apache
              ```C:/Apache24/bin/httpd.exe -k restart```
7. **Download MySQL**
    - Download MySQL Installer 8.0 via the link:  
      [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
